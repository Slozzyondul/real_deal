        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
        Hello, it must be fun doing this continuously. Its like the more i invest my time in this the more i want to acquire more information.
        first, i come from a humbled background, i didnt really have much growing up. My dad was my best buddy, he raised me in his house and the number of times we
        shifted houses is uncountable.
        He used to tell me everyday always yearn to acquire knowledge and wisdom because it the only thing that will make you stand out.
        I kept my head under the wave and focused on only maths because i knew its universaly applicable in any field.
        Soon my love for computers came in when i joined high school, at first i couldnt name any component of a computer, operating it was something alien to me.
        That did not stop me from pursuing my ambition of understanging how this compiled hardware is able to outsmart the most smartest brains in data time processing.
        At first i didnt have any direction what i wanted to do, so i took a computer studies class as my technical subject because i enjoy being challenged with new ideas.
        I realized there are vast career opportunity in computing world. 
        
        here i am
        Now learning data science at my own using the freely available online resources because i understand problm solving with a mathematics approach.
